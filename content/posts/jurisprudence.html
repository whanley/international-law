description: "Which states were most prominent in Clunet's jurisprudence reporting?"
---



<p>The “Jurisprudence” section of Clunet contains thousands of “bulletins” reporting decisions. The section is subdivided by state. This scatterplot captures the number of bulletins for each state and their average length.</p>
<p>Number of bulletins is one proxy for the notability of a state. Of course, not all of these states were present throughout the sixty-five year period. I’ll break out time series in future graphs.</p>
<p>Length of bulletin is one proxy for the depth of engagement with jurisprudence. At present this measure slightly misrepresents the jurisprudence bulletins, however. Many bulletins contained more than one report, but I have not yet managed to subdivide this section of the journal.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/jurisprudence_files/figure-html/all-states-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This plot shows only those states with more than five jurisprudence bulletins. Clearly France is an outlier both in terms of count and length. A relatively compact group of nine states comes next in prominence.</p>

<p>Among non-European states, Egypt is most prominent. Brazil and the “Échelles du Levant” (non-Ottoman Mediterranean ports subject to the capitulations) come next. A cluster of French colonies stands out, and Latin American states are relatively numerous. Asian states are remarkable for their slight presence.</p>
