<p>Clunet is subdivided into sections, each featuring a different genre of writing. If the text is mined without distinguishing between the different characters of these sections, results will be soupy. I have divided the text into these sections, following the journal’s own classification scheme. This table omits three sections that appeared for only a few years each: “Actualités”, “Revue des Revues”, and “Variétés”.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/divisions-clunet_files/figure-html/faceted-divs-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Wartime spikes are particularly notable. Unlike other journals, Clunet increased publication during wartime.</p>
<p>Here’s a more impressionistic streamgraph of the same content (also including the minor divisons).</p>
