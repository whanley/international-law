      <description>This chart counts references to selected states the standalone articles in Clunet. The pattern seems to differ from the pattern in jurisprudence. Egypt is less prominent, while the Ottomans and Russia are more prominent. China, Greece, and Japan show a few outlying points, most produced by a single article focused on that state.
If we look at the pattern of occurence of the same words in the test of the jurisprudence bulletins themselves, we notice that the Ottoman empire and Turkey are less prominent.</description>
