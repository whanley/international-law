      <description>A large share of the Bulletin de la Société de Législation Comparée was devoted to membership lists. The membership was overwhelmingly French, at first; foreign members were listed separately.
I scraped the residence listed for foreign members for 1878, 1885, 1892, 1900, 1909, and 1918. I cleaned it up a bit with OpenRefine and mapped it in Tableau. This video blends screenshots from Tableau. Not the cleanest workflow; I&amp;rsquo;ll do something better (and complete) eventually.</description>
