<h2>Underlying code</h2>
<p>These code blocks repeat the same steps for each of three journals. It might be good to figure out how to do all three in one step.</p>
<p>First, load text of all files</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(xml2)

bslc_files &lt;- dir(&quot;~/GitHub/ilcorpus/journals/bslc/bslc-issues&quot;, full.names = TRUE)
bslc_text &lt;- c()
for (f in bslc_files) {
  bslc_text &lt;- c(bslc_text, gsub(&quot;\\s+&quot;, &quot; &quot;, paste(xml_text(xml_find_all(read_xml(f), &quot;//text()&quot;)), collapse=&quot; &quot;)))
}

clunet_files &lt;- dir(&quot;~/GitHub/ilcorpus/journals/clunet/clunet-issues&quot;, full.names = TRUE)
clunet_text &lt;- c()
for (f in clunet_files) {
  clunet_text &lt;- c(clunet_text, gsub(&quot;\\s+&quot;, &quot; &quot;, paste(xml_text(xml_find_all(read_xml(f), &quot;//text()&quot;)), collapse=&quot; &quot;)))
}

rdilc_files &lt;- dir(&quot;~/GitHub/ilcorpus/journals/rdilc/rdilc-issues&quot;, full.names = TRUE)
rdilc_text &lt;- c()
for (f in rdilc_files) {
  rdilc_text &lt;- c(rdilc_text, gsub(&quot;\\s+&quot;, &quot; &quot;, paste(xml_text(xml_find_all(read_xml(f), &quot;//text()&quot;)), collapse=&quot; &quot;)))
}</code></pre>
<p>Tokenize the words, then count them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tokenizers)

clunet_words &lt;- tokenize_words(clunet_text)
sapply(clunet_words, length)
bslc_words &lt;- tokenize_words(bslc_text)
sapply(bslc_words, length)
rdilc_words &lt;- tokenize_words(rdilc_text)
sapply(rdilc_words, length)</code></pre>
<p>I prepared separate metadata summaries about each journal, drawing year and date from the TEI header of each file. These summaries will probably be useful in future steps. For now, get and use date metadata about every issue:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

bslc_metadata &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/GitHub/ilcorpus/journals/bslc/bslc-summary.csv&quot;)
clunet_metadata &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/GitHub/ilcorpus/journals/clunet/clunet-summary.csv&quot;)
rdilc_metadata &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/GitHub/ilcorpus/journals/rdilc/rdilc-summary.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now, produce a tibble for each journal, with each issue (there was more than one per year) its own observation. This tibble lists the issue, word count, and abbreviated title of the journal.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bslc_word_count &lt;- tibble(year = bslc_metadata$year, words = sapply(bslc_words, length), journal = &quot;bslc&quot;)
clunet_word_count &lt;- tibble(year = clunet_metadata$year, words = sapply(clunet_words, length), journal = &quot;clunet&quot;)
rdilc_word_count &lt;- tibble(year = rdilc_metadata$year, words = sapply(rdilc_words, length), journal = &quot;clunet&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now cluster word counts by year:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>clunet_word_count_year &lt;- clunet_word_count %&gt;% 
  group_by(year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(words = sum(words), journal = &quot;clunet&quot;)
bslc_word_count_year &lt;- bslc_word_count %&gt;% 
  group_by(year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(words = sum(words), journal = &quot;bslc&quot;)
rdilc_word_count_year &lt;- rdilc_word_count %&gt;% 
  group_by(year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(words = sum(words), journal = &quot;rdilc&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Put all three journals in a single tibble:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>journals_count &lt;- full_join(clunet_word_count_year, bslc_word_count_year)
journals_count &lt;- full_join(journals_count, rdilc_word_count_year)</code></pre>
<p>Plot the results as points and smoothing line</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- ggplot(data = journals_count, mapping = aes(x = year, y = words, color = journal))
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-05-28-journals_files/figure-html/plot%20code-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Plot the results as a streamgraph:</p>
